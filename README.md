# LoxoBASIC

LoxoBASIC is an interpreter for classic BASIC programs, of the sort you
might find in David H. Ahl's "BASIC Computer Games" collection.

## Usage

LoxoBASIC is generally accepting of different BASIC standards, and
endeavors to be flexible is the code formats it accepts. This also allows
tricks that are not possible (or wise) in more traditional interpreters.

LoxoBASIC is under heavy development, and should not be expected to be
particularly useful in its present form.
